# Github Repository Info App

## Introduction

The angular app takes any name/keyword of a repository name as a input and gives all the list of repositories using the github api v3. There is a filter for sorting and pagination is also added. Clicking on any on the list of repo will redirect to a detail page where more information about the repository is given along with properly formatted readme file for that repo. For formatting the markdown file, npm package called ngx-markdown is used. The angular project is version 13.
